Cape is a suite of open-source libraries to manage a question-answering model that answers questions by "reading" documents automatically. It is based on state-of-the-art machine reading models trained on massive datasets, and includes several mechanisms to make it easy to use and improve based on user feedback. It has been designed to be portable, i.e. works on a single laptop or on a cluster of parallel machines to speedup computation, and is Open Source friendly to be used at all expertise levels.

Check it out [here]([https://github.com/bloomsburyai/cape-webservices), It really is **super easy** to use.
