## Natural Language Patrick
<br>
I'm a London-based AI and Natural Language Processing Research Scientist, currently working at Meta AI Research.
Before this, I was a PhD student, splitting my time between Facebook AI Research (FAIR) and University College London.

I'm interested in how to represent, store and access knowledge and building more powerful, efficient and robust models for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks such as Question Answering and Fact Checking.

I also occasionally tweet [here](https://twitter.com/PSH_Lewis).
