## Natural Language Patrick
<br>
I'm a London-based Natural Language Processing PhD student, splitting my time between Facebook AI Research (FAIR) and University College London.

I'm interested in how to represent, store and access knowledge and building more powerful, efficient and robust models for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks such as question answering.

I also occasionally blog about my research [here](/post/), and tweet [here](https://twitter.com/PSH_Lewis).
