## Natural Language Patrick
<br>
I'm a London-based Natural Language Processing PhD student, splitting my time between FAIR and University College London.

I'm interested in how we can design neural natural language systems which encode and exploit annotations more effectively. 

I also maintain a [blog](/post/) about my research. I hope you'll find it interesting and perhaps useful for your own work. Feedback and discussion is definitely welcome!
