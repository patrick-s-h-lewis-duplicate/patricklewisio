## Natural Language Patrick
<br>
I'm a London-based Natural Language Processing PhD student, splitting my time between Facebook AI Research (FAIR) and University College London.

I'm interested in how we can design neural natural language systems which exploit human annotations much more effectively, particularly in question answering. 

I also occasionally blog about my research [here](/post/), and tweet [here](https://twitter.com/PSH_Lewis).
