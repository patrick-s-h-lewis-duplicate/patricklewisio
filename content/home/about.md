## Natural Language Patrick
<br>
I'm a London-based AI and Natural Language Processing Research Scientist, working at [co:here](https://cohere.ai/).
Before this, I was a research scientist at the Fundamental AI Research Lab (FAIR) at Meta AI.
I completed my PhD working with Sebastian Riedel and Pontus Stenetorp, splitting my time between FAIR nd University College London.

I work at the intersection of information retrieval techniques (IR) and large language models (LLMs), and have done a lot of work on <em>Retrieval-Augmented Language Models</em>.

I'm interested in how to represent, store and retrieve <em>knowledge</em> for use in large language models.
My work focuses on building more powerful, efficient, robust and update-able models that can perform well on a wide range of NLP tasks, but also excel on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks such as Question Answering and Fact Checking.

I also occasionally tweet [here](https://twitter.com/PSH_Lewis).
